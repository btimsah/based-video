Just upload and activate in WordPress.
Within the post editor you can now easily embed a paywalled video with a set free preview timer.
You can optionally allow buyers to download the video file as well.
Buyers are presented an in-browser success message and video continues to play upon successful on-chain confirmation of their payment.
Buyers can log back into each video, along with the order lookup shortcode.
Order attempts (success or fail) are preserved on the backend and admin is email alerted.
Admin can manually approve an order.
STORJ works great for the video because they're far faster than most web-hosts, affordable, decentralized and provide direct video url access.
USDC on base is a great token and network for paywall video because of it's speed, stable/clear pricing.
