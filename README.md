Just upload and activate in WordPress.
Within the post/page editor you can now easily embed a premium video.
You can optionally allow buyers to download the video file as well.
Buyers are presented an in-browser success message and video continues to play upon successful on-chain confirmation of their payment.
Buyers can just re-enter their email to re-access at a later date, along with the order lookup shortcode.
Order attempts (success or fail) are preserved on the backend and admin is email alerted.
Admin can manually approve an order.
STORJ works great for the video because they're far faster than most web-hosts, affordable, decentralized and provide direct video url access.
Downloaders are welcome to edit it as needed.
